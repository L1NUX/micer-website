# micer-website
Website for the 2018/19 school year 9th-grade MICER() "political party".

A friend of mine is running for 2018/19 9th-grade president, and wanted a "tech guru" to make a website for them. Hopefully going to have a campaign information page, a (fake) donations page, a sign up page, and (maybe) a forums page.
